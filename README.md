QtSciPoster
===========

A desktop program that will use qtweb to create large A0 posters, great if you already know css and are sick of making posters in powerpoint

The initial objectives are:
 + A html/css editing window
 + A 'live' preview screen - scaled to fit - with zoom in and out features
 + A set of standard css files to provide a grid system for quick layouts
 + A basic poster example file
 + A button to render the file to an image (this is based on a program called webcapture http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/graphics-dojo)
 + Options for render zoom, to save memory
	
Further objectives (no idea how to do yet)
 + some way to share layouts with others
 + graphic rendering
 + support for equations
